# StateMachines

A Collection of state machine packages useful for power systems modelling.

## Library description

Main focus is a replacement of the obsoleted PetriNet based controllers from the
[ObjectStab](https://github.com/modelica-3rdparty/ObjectStab) library.
The controllers are rewritten from scratch using Modelica 3.3 State Machine
semantics. Some documentation was taken from the original ObjectStab library
